# FSMAssist - TODO

This file tracks the high-level tasks for the `aGi²TEAM³FSMbot¹` project.

## Milestone 1: Stabilize Core and Prove Principles

- [x] **Resolve Critical Rendering Errors:** Stabilize the Next.js application and eliminate the `PageNotFoundError`.
- [ ] **Refine FSM Agent Implementations:** Review and harden the logic for all existing FSM components (`/src/components/fsm/*`).
- [ ] **Flesh out IDE-Matrix:** Implement basic file editing and terminal command simulation.
- [ ] **Verify `chckpt1-a2.t3.fb1.md` Alignment:** Ensure all components and flows adhere to the principles outlined in the checkpoint document.
- [ ] **Implement Remaining "Mop Boy" Agents:** Create placeholders or basic implementations for any FSMs mentioned in the documentation but not yet built.
- [ ] **Configure `settings.json`:** Fully integrate the `settings.json` file to control agentic workflows.
