# The VAULT: Core Principles & Operational Blueprint

This directory serves as the immutable "source of truth" for the `aGi²TEAM³FSMbot¹` project. It contains the master plans, architectural principles, and operational instructions that govern the entire system, including all human and AI agents.

This is the constitution of our factory. All agents, including the Chief Architect (human) and the Master Craftsman (AI Coder), are bound by the principles documented here. The `Supermax` Universal Compliance Agent will use these documents as the basis for its audits.
